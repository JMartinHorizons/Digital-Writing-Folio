# *Week 1*

- [ ] Create a GitHub account
- [ ] Do the GitHub "Hello World" module
- [ ] Add a repository for the folio
- [ ] What types of writing do you do? (i.e. fiction, nonficiton, poetry, other)
> I write broadly across forms, usually following from my readings or interests.
- [ ] What tools or techniques do you use to write? 
> In terms of tools, I use pen and paper or word processors, though I also occasionally sound out my writing using a voice recorder on my phone. I like a physical keyboard, and a larger format of paper. I dislike feeling cramped when I write, which can be the case with certain applications. Though it depends on form and content, I'll usually write a rough rush of ideas, themes and fragements, then see about putting a shape to the piece and outlining it more specifically or with more polish. 
- [ ] How do these tools shape the way you write? (e.g. constrain the way you write, or facilitate your writing)
