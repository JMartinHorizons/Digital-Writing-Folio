# *Week 1*

- [ ] Create a GitHub account
- [ ] Do the GitHub "Hello World" module
- [ ] Add a repository for the folio
- [ ] What types of writing do you do? (i.e. fiction, nonficiton, poetry, other)
> I write broadly across forms, usually following from my readings or interests. Recently, I've  written a fair amount of poetry and personal nonfiction writing. 
- [ ] What tools or techniques do you use to write? 
> In terms of tools, I use pen and paper or word processors, though I also occasionally sound out my writing using a voice recorder on my phone. I like a physical keyboard and a larger format of paper. I dislike feeling cramped when I write, which can be the case with certain applications or notebooks. Though it depends on form and content, I'll usually write a rough rush of ideas, themes and fragements, then see about putting a shape to the piece and outlining it more specifically or with more polish. 
- [ ] How do these tools shape the way you write? (e.g. constrain the way you write, or facilitate your writing)
> Starting with fairly rushed first efforts, editing is a fairly large part of the process. For this, physical and digital formats offer their own pros and cons. It can be helpful to have reminders of the changes made as physical elements left on a page, while it can also be cleaner and more conducive to finishing a piece to delete things in a processer. I tend to find that I also write quicker and with a little less attention when I write with processors. There is less wasted motion than if I need to use pan and paper, though I can also afford to write with a little less thought.
