# *Week 1*

- Create a GitHub account
- Do the GitHub "Hello World" module
- Add a repository for the folio
- What types of writing do you do? (i.e. fiction, nonficiton, poetry, other)
> I write broadly across forms, usually following from my readings or interests. Recently, I've  written a fair amount of poetry and personal nonfiction writing. 
- What tools or techniques do you use to write? 
> In terms of tools, I use pen and paper or word processors, though I also occasionally sound out my writing using a voice recorder on my phone. I like a physical keyboard and a larger format of paper. I dislike feeling cramped when I write, which can be the case with certain applications or notebooks. Though it depends on form and content, I'll usually write a rough rush of ideas, themes and fragements, then see about putting a shape to the piece and outlining it more specifically or with more polish. 
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
> I have to say mostly out of habit; convenience is key. I tend to find that most ideas and inspiration comes from experiences away from the desk, so the tools I use come at a later stage, when things have had time to ferment a bit and they need to effectively flow on from experience.
- How do these tools shape the way you write? (e.g. constrain the way you write, or facilitate your writing)
> Starting with fairly rushed first efforts, editing is a fairly large part of the process. For this, physical and digital formats offer their own pros and cons. It can be helpful to have reminders of the changes made as physical elements left on a page, while it can also be cleaner and more conducive to finishing a piece to delete things in a processer. I tend to find that I also write quicker and with a little less attention when I write with processors. There is less wasted motion than if I need to use pan and paper, though I can also afford to write with a little less thought. 

# *Week 2*

- What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
> Tarako: The words and line structure are the main elements at play. Cloud: There is a poetic treatment of the text in this piece, but it's predominantly pushed forward using visual elements and hyperlinks. Revolution: Text based, with role-playing elements. Shade: Text based again.
- How are those elements meaningful?
> Tarako: The infinite play between the different combinations of words and the poetic structure works to create a fugue-like state. I think it's succesful in presenting the chaotic assembly that nature tends to fall into. Cloud: I like that this work incorporates the viewer into the cloud through reading, but I was a little cooler on the visual presentation and activity. Revolution: I think the role-playing elements of this work quite well, the sense of producing a character or understanding them is well exercised with each letter sent. Shade: control is important, and whether we believe/ know it is in the reader's or the author's hands. As the story of Shade progresses and we realise that our choices are already largely determined, it creates points of meaningful dissonance.
- How are the works read differently from print literature?
> Tarako: It can't be stored, recalled or practised like poetry typically can, which makes it much more ephemeral. Cloud: it feel much more like viewing an experimental art piece in a gallery, which you could argue is a fuzy point between art, writing and installation works. It becomes a complex, variable experience completly unlike a book. Revolution: In some ways it's like a choose your own adventure, though there isn't really a way to change a physical text as comprehensively as there is with Revolution. There is a dialogue between altering and the responses that goes a long way to creating intimate and compelling character interactions. Shade: Far more reader interaction than a traditional work.
- How is electronic literature different from print literature?
> The various ways that electronic literature allows for randomized outputs and reader engagement are most apparent to me, but there are other aspects like linking and live feed integration that are fairly compelling. These simply wouldn't be available in print literature, without convoluted or innaccesible methods. As we've seen, these techniques are enmeshed with the internet/ information age - they speak to it and for it. E-lit is inseperable from the times it was born in.
- What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?
> Direct, substantial reader interaction; randomization and ephemeral works; integration with external information sources (i.e. hyperlinks, APIs); concern for contemporary issues like e-waste, climate change, social media.

## Questions on remix of 'Tarako Gorge': 'Camel Tail' by Sonny Rae Tempest
- What aspects of the remix are the same?
> The remix follows the general kinetic form, in that it dissappears after 24 lines. The stanzas are quatrains ass opposed to sonnets, and the content is, of course, completly different. There is character to the poem now (as in, pronouns imply conversation/ people) and the themes are vastly different. It feels much more musical, and they seem much more like lyrical than poetic word choice.
- What aspects of the remix are different?
> See above
- Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
> In some ways I like this remix more than the original, the words tend to work together better, and there is a more lyrical sense to the stanzas. The directness of the address (having pronouns) adds a more conversational or dialogue sense to the piece. Similarly, the new themes and content tends to make for a more colourful, energetic poem. I think this remix succeds in using the constrains of the original poem with a fresh source of words and themes. It's like a generator for endless lyrics that looks back on the lyrics themselves
