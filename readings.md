[The responses to the readings below are the brief summations and takeaways that I note down. Page markups aren't included]

## Week 1
### *Electronic Literature: What is it?* - Katherine Hayles N (2007)
Extensive review of the contemporary e-lit scene. Outlines problems with interpretation and preservation, which are interesting in their historical context. 
‘Hypertext fiction, network fiction, interactive fiction, locative narratives, installation pieces, "codework," generative art and the Flash poem are by no means an exhaustive inventory of the forms of electronic literature, but they are sufficient to illustrate the diversity of the field, the complex relations that emerge between print and electronic literature, and the wide spectrum of aesthetic strategies that digital literature employs.’

### *Decolonize E-Literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden* - Inman Berens K (2020)
Geographical overview of different approaches and traditions in e-lit. North American predominantly, but other regions have used it to question authorship, readership and technological inputs. 

### *The Origins of Electronic Literature: An Overview* - Di Rosario G et al. (2021)
Brings the e-lit critical overview into a more contemporary frame. Struggles with platformers is interesting, as is tension between traditional and popular e-lit examples (e.g. Kaur, instapoetry)

## Week 2
### *Enlightening Interactive Fiction:Andrew Plotkin’s Shade* - Douglass J (2008)
Responds to Shade. The story of Shade is that the narrator is hallucinating this experience of their apartment while they are actually dying in the desert. They attended a rave, then were lost and died of exposure. In the game’s final section, the player’s character/ role shifts to outside the narrator, who dies in the sand.
Attention is mostly drawn to how the interactive nature of the work allows some control over the narrator's fate, but ultimately this is illusory. Like interactive fiction, in that the control the reader has is still heavily guided.

### *Kissing the Steak: The Poetry of Text Generators* - Funkhouser C (2009)
Examines three functions used in text generators - permutation, combinatorics, and slots.
Predominantly these shift words/ language in ways that challenge our familiarity with meaning and convention. Sometimes it makes a swirling, indirect account of a place, or it makes something dystopian and Huxley-en about a ‘normal’ scene.

### *Introduction [of Oulipo: A primer of Potential Literature]* - Motte W (1986)
Introduces the history of the Oulipo group, and their approach to using  constraints on their writing, e.g. Georges Perec who wrote a novel without the letter e, the poem A Hundred Thousand Million Poems. 
Mathematics as inspiration and as a fundamental informing aspect of literature/ writing. 

## Week 3
### *Indistinguishable from Magic: Invisible Interfaces and Digital Literature as Demystifier* - Emerson L (2014)
 Highly interesting in its criticism (?) of changing ways we engage with interfaces - mainly, movement towards un-noticed, invisible. I remember reading about the shifts in internet usage, how it has changed from the early days of self-run blogs to the pages and accounts of current day social media. In a similar way, the engagement with underlying systems has changed. 
Elision of the medium, such as through its ubiquity, distances us from being able to create through it, makes us solely consumers, but 'a growing body of digital literature courts difficulty, defamiliarization, and glitch as antidotes to this receding present.'

### *Beyond Taxonomy: Digital Poetics and the Problem of Reading* - Memmott T (2006)
Goes over examples of digital poetry. Difficulty of confining or nailing down definitions of it, due to the varied approaches to it. Hard to describe the pieces better than the text does. A common conceit is movement of words, I would say making many of the examples akin to concrete poetry. 
'....the critic or theorist of hypermedia should move toward becoming a poetician, interested in how digital works are made, how technology, code, media, and intent play together in the formation of poetic hypermedia.'

## Week 4

## Week 5
### *No Sense of an Ending: Hypertext Aesthetics* - Aarseth E (1997)
“When Ted Nelson first coined the word hypertext in 1965, he was thinking of a new way of organizing text so that it could be read in a sequence chosen by the reader, rather than followed only in the sequence laid down by the writer.”
Speaks about Afternoon, a hypertext piece that works on linking through individual words. Novel like, but fractured/ fragmented into a confusing, non-linear personal account. 

### *Hypertext Fiction Ever After* - Moulthrop S (2021)
Details history and aspects of hypertext, links it to Twine in the modern time. Perhaps raises ideas of these sorts of texts as going beyond the ‘human’ in literary spaces. 'Ergodic' - a term borrowed from mathematics that refers to the behaviour of a system and how it moves/ behaves in a relatively predictable, yet random way. 
'Twine writers seem less interested in high-cultural approbation, better adapted to dynamics of social media, and more interested in taking their fight to institutions that academics often shun.'

### *Patterns Of Hypertext* - Bernstein M (1998)
Trees and cycles are fairly apparent from my previous contact with hypertext games, and they are patterns or structures that I think have come to underpin quite a few games. The other patterns listed here are interesting, and there don't seem to be hard rules. I can imagine how a montage-type work could be varied or expanded greatly, like 'The Gathering Cloud' from week 1. 

## Week 6
### *Riddles* - Montfort N (2004)
Montfort makes a good case for a literary heritage that IF is borrowing from. It's worth breaking down the various prompts that can be asked for in IF. I've played games that were obviously using the knowledge of the player in ways that were like riddles, such as whether you knew the name of a character, or how to interact with them properly. 

### *On Savoir-Faire* - Short E (2007)
Provides some information on Short’s previous hyperlink-type game, which used a mechanic of linking to provide interesting gameplay and interaction with the game world. It works well with text, and the relatively contained world of the game. I'm not sure how much work would need to go into this; it's exactly the sort of game that worries me in terms of development time and difficulty. A simple idea could quickly grow out of control.

### *Mindwheel (or, The Poet and the Hackers) - Maher J 2014
I liked this reading for the history and personal inspiration it provides. Pinsky's personal response to the challenge of a new medium is fascinating, and it's a useful example of an artist's creative process. Mindwheel balanced its literary aspiration with puzzles that emphasised 'poetics, dialog and symbolism rather than a bunch of mechanistic operations.' I think its important to take into consideration the differences between the approach of making literature and making entertainment. 

## Week 7
### *The Paradox of Poetic Gaming: evidence of everything exploding* - Ensslin A (2014)
The text examines three examples of poetic games that subvert gameplay traditions and expectations to create a type of poetic play between textual elements. 
I felt that the initial definition of a 'poetic game' was somewhat constrained. The idea that there needs to be some sort of gamification of the actual words seems limiting. 

EEE - links documents through a platformer-like act of 'reading'. 
Arteroids - uses shooting mechanics like Asteroids playfully.
Silent Conversation - players are a cursor line that jumps across words taken from classic writing. It gets harder and harder to actually read the words. 

### *Poetic Playlands: Poetry, Interface, and Video Game Engines* - Nelson J (2021)
Nelson is a poet and digital artist whose work is interactive and collage-based. He interprets websites/ texts that make points of interactivity and the popularity of his own works. Much of his pieces work on ease of use/ challange. Like works that I've previously seen, it takes the 'concrete' approach, interacting with the actual text as enemies/ obstacles.  

## Week 8
*No texts set*

## Week 9
### *Excavating Logics of White Supremacy in Electronic Literature: Antiracism as Infrastructural Critique* - Ikeda R (2021)
Quite a serious and thorough text on the way that racism and representation is handled in the e-lit space. Databases are a contentious space, like many systems that aren't consciously reviewed with inclusion and equity in mind. '[E-lit gatekeepers] engage systems-immanent criticism but not self-criticism.' 

## Week 10
### *Arriving Simultaneously: Selections from a writer’s Notebook* - Molloy J (2020)
'Arriving Simultaneously: Selections from a Writer's Notebook" is a collection of writer's notebook entries that document the creation of the electronic manuscript, Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-flung Systems.' 
An interesting example of an exegesis or reflective text. Confusing in some ways, and plays on the presentation that the piece being developed also relies on (coloured text to differentiate voices/ sections). 

## Week 11
### *Publishing Electronic Literature* - O'Sullivan J (2021)
Raises several interesting points around the difference between publishing traditional and e-literature. It's a strong case to take the publishing into the author's own hands, though there are still things like upkeep, assistance and hosting to consider. For my own work, it could be very easily put through to itch.io or the Twine website. Perhaps a more experimental or poetic e-lit piece would need a publisher or online literary groups help to publish.  

## Week 12
